## Overview
This repository is a collection of Isiah Jones security ideas, created and collected templates, tools, methodologies, resume, experiences, projects, and research etcetera. It contains practical resources and examples to aid in turning policy, standards, regulations, guidelines and best or good practices into practical implementation. These resources were created and gathered to solve practical implementation execution problems and as my contribution to the security community. This repository also serves to demonstrate some of my knowledge, skills, abilities, interests, and experiences. 

## Content Topics
** Threat Modeling - I created an AI agent based threat modeling analysis tool for automating some of the analytical steps in threat modeling. The tool focuses on threat modeling components, devices, and systems, particularly IoT, ICS, OT, IIoT, embedded devices and embedded systems. 

** Assessments and Testing - These are templates I created from on the job experiences as well as formal trainings, education, and research. They can be used for several types of security, risk, mission assurance, threat, and vulnerability assessments as well as security testing, acceptance testing etcetera. 

** Resume - my resumes show some of my relevant career experiences, certifications, degrees, and trainings. This is shared for those who wish to collaborate on projects and organizations looking employees or consultants with my breadth and depth of experiences. 

** Other tools, templates, and research - I share tools, research, and other templates that I have collected, learned, or created that may be helpful for someone in the community.
