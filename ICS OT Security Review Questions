## Architecture and Network
•	Have security zones, architecture levels and conduits been defined and mapped? 
•	Has a testing zone and work bench area been included or created? 
•	Have safety zones been created?
•	Have facilities, fire, mass communication, physical access and other building related control systems been included? 
•	Have tiers of logging, alarm management, types of protocols and segmentation been implemented? 
•	How are RF/wireless components in cabinets as well as peripheral devices (e.g. laptops and phones) accounted for in architecture security zones? 
•	Are P&ID, network and process flow diagrams current and accurate? Do they identify devices, their conduits, protocols, systems, zones and locations? 
•	How is cloud and remote access accounted for? 

## Devices and Components
•	Has a general inventory of types of devices been created? 
•	Are devices broken up into classes and levels?
•	Have basic device features (e.g. conduit type, protocol, IP, MAC and ports been captured)?
•	Are asset tags assigned?
•	Are there spare parts? 
•	Are portable and peripheral assets accounted for? (e.g. tablets, phones, ID/badge, tokens, laptops, USB etc.)
•	Have technical manuals and data sheets been collected from vendors and integrators? 

## Applications and Systems
•	Has a basic inventory and classification of types of applications and systems been created? (e.g. types of DCS, SCADA, PLC, Historian, HMI software, operating systems etc.)
•	Has ports, protocols and services and APIs been captured?
•	Has a patch management process including testing, roll back and deployment been created? 
•	Has alarming and notifications been defined and mapped? For which applications and systems? How do they communicate on the network? 

## Users, Roles and Responsibilities
•	Have users been defined and documented? (e.g. organic employee vs contractor vs third party OEM etc.)
•	Has role-based access control been implemented?
•	Has configuration, maintenance and changes been tracked, defined and understood? Is there a detailed work order process that tracks date, time, system, person, roll etc. for changes? 
•	Has continuity of operations and emergency ad hoc roles or privilege changes been considered, defined and tested? (e.g. emergency stop roles, ad hoc changes in privileges etc.)?
