# Assessment Request list:

## Data Needed Before Onsite:
•	Plant points of contacts (e.g. control systems engineers, production engineers, plant maintenance (control systems), project engineering, physical security/HSE/ERT, nonintegrated sites include HR, IT support onsite) 
•	Configuration, services, ports, protocols, software list for machines, workstations and devices (e.g. Rockwell Stratix Switches, upstream or downstream switches, any serial to Ethernet devices, PLCs, programmable VFDs, HMIs, workstations etc)
•	Existing documentation and folks that understand it to walk me through their plant ops, the processes of each line and products produced (e.g. brands) – network diagrams, system diagrams, pdf dump of PLCs and VFDs code logic (Ladder, Function Block etc), process and instrument diagrams etc
•	Line drawings, network diagrams, plant layout diagrams 
•	Network packet captures of plant level and specific line/field panel/zone level traffic (will need traffic captures to be less than 1 gig for each snapshot or will need ability to plug in my laptop or tools to mirror ports to sniff and capture sample traffic myself if customer can’t provide it to me)
•	Policies, procedures, playbooks (configuration management, Incident response, access control, asset & inventory management, requirements/specification docs (e.g. EQ/FRM/URS/HDS/SRS), change control, acceptance testing), 
•	Existing policies and procedures for access control, system support SLAs, configuration management (e.g. think supply chain access to their ops and assets)


## Necessary Interviews and Walkdown Access While Onsite:
•	Someone to give an overview of company, plant operations, product lines produced in plant, products produced by the lines, processes, zones, locations in scope etc
•	Folks in charge of the OEM relationships, OEM onsite support reps if they are onsite that week (e.g. usually a gold mine of information on what they’re actually doing to the systems vs what customers think they’re doing especially additional unknown attack surfaces via people or assets)
•	Folks who run the plant and each of the lines
•	Understanding of their safety program particularly safety risk on each of the production lines and within the plant itself (any policies, procedures they have to share as well)
•	Someone from maintenance to give insights on facilities support to plant (e.g. climate, environmental, lighting, backup power, CCTV, badge systems etc)
•	Someone from corporate IT knowledgeable of support within the plant
•	Someone with local admin/config rights to machines, workstations and devices (e.g. Rockwell Stratix Switches, upstream or downstream switches, any serial to Ethernet devices, PLCs, programmable VFDs, HMIs, workstations etc)
•	Will need permission to take screenshots and or photos with a canon digital camera of configurations, installed software, running services, user accounts, conduit, process machines connected to controllers etc
•	Will need permission and someone with local admin access to run requested windows systems internals scripts that quickly pulls running ports, services, installed software, users etc for any windows OS (including CE on the Panel View HMIs). scripts are provided to customer for their inspection if needed.  (permission to use consultant dev laptops or a customer provided laptop with local admin account to load and customize tools)
